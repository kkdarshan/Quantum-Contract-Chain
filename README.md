Quantum Contract Chain V3 – Hybrid Blockchain + Encrypted Contract System

Overview:

Quantum Contract Chain V3 (QCC-V3) is a hybrid blockchain system that combines:

Public tamper-proof blockchain (stored as blockchain.json)

Private AES-encrypted contract storage (stored in MySQL)

Quantum-inspired validation (collapse mechanism)

Admin dashboard for decrypting and verifying contracts

Public blockchain explorer for hashed data only


This project simulates how a real-world quantum-secure contract system would work.


Key Features:

1. Hybrid Storage Architecture

Public Layer:
Stores hashed owner + contract data in blockchain.json

Private Layer:
Stores AES-256 encrypted original contract details in MySQL

Ensures privacy + immutability at the same time



2. Blockchain Ledger

Each block contains:

Owner Hash

Data Hash

Timestamp

Previous Block Hash

Quantum Key

Post-Quantum Signature

Entangled Block Hash (simulated)

Current State → pending / active / settled


All block hashes are computed using SHA-256.



3. Quantum-Inspired Collapse (Smart Contract State)

Each block can “collapse” into:

ACTIVE

SETTLED


based on multi-validator random votes (simulating quantum measurement & consensus).



4. AES Encryption for Private Data

Original contract + owner details are encrypted using:

AES-128 (ECB), Base64 encoded

Only the admin (with password) can decrypt the records.



5. Admin Dashboard

Accessible at:

/admin?password=YOUR_PASSWORD

Admin can:

View decrypted contract details

Verify blockchain integrity

Ensure encrypted DB matches public blockchain

Detect tampering or mismatches



6. Public Blockchain Explorer

Accessible at:

/chain

Shows only hashed data, keeping user privacy protected.




7. Update / Delete Support

Update block data (updates blockchain + DB)

Delete block (removes from chain + DB)

Re-indexes chain automatically

Maintains blockchain integrity

⚙ Setup Instructions

1. Install MySQL

Create database:

CREATE DATABASE qcc_v3;

The table is auto-created.

2. Update DB credentials

In Main.java:

private static final String DB_URL  = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/qcc_v3";
private static final String DB_USER = "root";
private static final String DB_PASS = "YOUR_PASSWORD";

🧠 How the System Works (In Simple Steps)

1️⃣ User enters contract (owner + data)
2️⃣ System hashes data → stores hash in blockchain
3️⃣ System encrypts original data → stores in SQL
4️⃣ Blockchain ensures immutability
5️⃣ SQL ensures privacy
6️⃣ Collapse mechanism decides contract state
7️⃣ Admin can decrypt + verify anytime
